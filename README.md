# more-vim

Up your ViM game with "more-vim"... more power.

This program aims to help you quickly set and unset cool Vim features.

These features include

- A colorscheme of your choice... peachpuff by default
  - you can edit the `.vimrc` file in your directory if you prefer another
- Better syntax higlighting
- Better indentations
- Easier navigation

## How to install

1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/nanafox/more-vim.git
2. Change directory into the folder. `cd more-vim`
3. One more time, get yourself into the `src` folder
4. Run the `install.sh` script as root. `sudo bash install.sh`
   - you could as well, do a `chmod +x install.sh` and then `sudo ./install.sh`.
  both of these options work.
5. Once the installation is done... you'll see how to use the program.
It's a simple on or off argument you specify...
